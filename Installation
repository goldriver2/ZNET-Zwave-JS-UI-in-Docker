NOTE: this installation was on an original Z-net device (RPI-3b) with the Ezzee REV 09.12.14 board mounted on:

1- First strongly suggest to make a copy of the original SD card with win32 disk imager and keep original and copy safe 
2- Use a new SD card (minimum 32GIG suggested for Docker)
3- Install the Raspberry PI imager software https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
	- Start the RPI imager software
	- Select the RPI 3 for the Raspberry PI model
	- Select Raspberry PI OS (legacy 32-bit) as the OS 
	- Select my SD card (I used a new 32GB card)
4- Once copy process completed, remove SD card from computer and Insert the SD card in the Z-net device
5- Connect keyboard, mouse and HDMI screen to the Raspberry device
6- Plug power and let the PI Boot
	- Configure language, timezone
	- Use ‘pi’ as the usernoame and enter your own password
	- Configure the wifi network on your PI (note the ip adress of your device)
	- Wait until a message from the OS suggest updating the new installation and proceed with all the available updates
	- Select Restart
	- Activate VNC and SSH on the PI (so you can remotely access the either terminal or graphical interface) without keyboard,mouse and monitor
		- Click on the raspberry image
		- Select 'preferences' then 'configuration'
		- in the interface tab, activate 'SSH','VNC', 'serial port' and desactivate 'serial console' then validate
		- Don't reboott immediatly
	- Edit /boot/config.txt and disable Bluetooth if not the Ezzee board won’t be available to the /dev/ttyAMA0 port
		- Click on the terminal icon
		- Type and execute 'sudo nano /boot/config.txt'
		- Add following at the end of the file, 
			# Disable Bluetooth
			dtoverlay=disable-bt
		- Save and exit (CTRL-X) and Yes and enter
		- Reboot the PI (select the raspberry image, select disconnbect and then reboot)
	- You can now disconnect keyboard, mouse and monitor and you can connect to your PI either using VNC terminal or SSH using the IP adress noted above
7- Install Docker
	- Click on the terminal icon to open a terminal window
	- Type and execute ‘sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade’ to make sure you got all the latest packages installed 
	- Type and execute ‘curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh’ this process takes a few minutes to execute
	- Type and execute ‘sudo usermod -aG docker $USER’
	- Close the terminal window
	- Reboot your PI
8- Test and make sure docker was installed correctly
	- Click on the terminal icon to open a terminal window
	- Type and execute ‘docker run hello-world’
	- You should have a message with the following text in it: 
		“Hello from Docker!
		This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.”
10- Install and Run ZWave-JS-UI as a service:
	- Type and execute ‘sudo mkdir /opt/zwavejs-ui’
	- Type and execute ‘cd /opt/zwavejs-ui’
	- Type and execute ‘sudo nano /opt/zwavejs-ui/docker-compose.yml’
	- Cut and paste the following in the editor:
version: "3.7"
services:
  zwave-js-ui:
    container_name: zwave-js-ui
    image: zwavejs/zwave-js-ui:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    tty: true
    stop_signal: SIGINT
    environment:
      - SESSION_SECRET=mySecretSession
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
    devices:
      - '/dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/zwave'
    volumes:
      - ./store:/usr/src/app/store
    ports:
      - "8091:8091" # port for web interface
      - "3000:3000" # port for Z-Wave JS websocket server

	- Save and exit (CTRL-X) and Yes and enter
11- Now you can launch the docker compose container with 'docker compose up -d' or you can launch it without -d to see what's going on.
        - Type and execute ‘docker compose up -d’
	- first time it is run might take some time as it is donwloading packages
12- From here you should be able to connect to the Zwave-JS-UI typing 'your RPI IP adresss':8091 in a browser to get to the Z-wave-JS-UI interface
13- In the ZWave-js-is interface, in setting (cog wheel) under the zwave tab, make sure you type in /dev/zwave in the serial port and then select 'Save'
	-After about 2 minutes, the interface will reload and in thecontrol panel, if your Z-net used to have devices configured you should find them there
